        Since my early childhood. I have been into technology, 
        from a tablet to my first game console to my first phone,
         
        technology had played a major part in my life. I enjoy hobbies 
        such as playing volleyball, playing video games and riding my bike. 
        
        My goal is to one day have a great career in the field of technology 
        and truly make a way to a new future.

             <h3>Project 1: Todo App</h3>
             Now although what you may see is a simple app that you just type
              in any word and it gets added to the page by a click of a button, 
              there is more. Essentially this todo app was the first time I 
              experimented with the js server which at a first glance seems 
              very complicated to understand. And it was the server had many
               new pieces of code that I didn't know even existed which required
               me to do a lot of research in order to understand the basic 
               concept of a router. Though I have a basic understanding of js
                servers there is still more to uncover in life.

             <h3>Project 2: Tier List Project</h3>
                  This was one of the more simpler projects that I had done 
                  for my CS class. Though it was simpler it didn't mean it 
                  was easy. This project introduced me to using data transfer
                   and prevent default which were essentially in ensuring that 
                   the images in the tier list work properly. This project goes
                    to show to never judge a book by its cover as it could be 
                    hiding a lot of unknown info.

            <h3>Project 3: Connections Game</h3>
       
            This project was a team effort made by me and 3 other people. 
            This project demonstrated our communication by having each one of
             us handle a specific part of the website and a leader who gave 
             their input which led us closer to success. This project allowed 
             me to master Javascript by learning many new coding pieces that 
             were essential for getting the game to actually work.
